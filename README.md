# 🎓 Swift TDD: Example Project

This repository contains a basic Swift project built strictly using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. The code is intentionally minimal to maximize focus on the **Red, Green, Refactor** workflow.

---

## 🎯 What This Demonstrates

The primary goal of this project is to showcase practical proficiency in the TDD cycle:

* **Red (Failing Test First):** Every new feature begins with a test that is guaranteed to fail before any implementation code is written.

* **Green (Minimal Code):** Writing only the minimal code necessary to make the failing test pass.

* **Refactor (Improve Code Safely):** Improving the design, structure, and clarity of the code while all tests remain green.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Swift

* **Testing Framework:** **XCTest** (native to Xcode)

* **Environment:** Xcode
